# Open Source contribution guide

So, you've decided to contribute to an open-source project, selected it from our [list](projects.md) and want to start working? This guide will help you in this process.

## What to contribute?
It is a common misconception that to contribute to open-source projects, one has to code. Not true. Most open-source projects require much more than just code. You can use many other skills to help, such as:

 - Design skills 
   - Contribute to the styling of a project.
   - Help improve the UX.
   - Improve the branding of a project.
   - ...
 - Writing skills
   - Help improve the documentation.
   - Review texts within the project.
   - Help with translations.
   - ...
 - Organization skills
   - Organize knowledge sharing sessions.
   - Create online events.
   - Connect questions from StackOverflow to answers in the documentation.
   - ...
 - Coding skills
   - Pick up an issue and get to work.
   - Do code reviews.
   - Answer stack overflow questions.
   - ...

## The people in the project

Every open-source project contains people of different roles and commitments to the project. Typically there are:
- Authors: those who created the project.
- Owners: those with admin rights of the project.
- Maintainers: those who drive the vision.
- Contributors: those who have contributed to the project.
- Community Members: those who use the project.

If you look at the project you selected from our [list](projects.md) there might also be a list of 13|37 people who have contributed to your project, so you already have the advantage of knowing someone on the inside.

## Where to start?

Most projects have something called an issue-tracker ([example](https://github.com/bUnit-dev/bUnit/issues)). Here you can find the active TODOs of a project. Most projects also have some tagging strategy. If you look at the tags you will often find something similar to "good first issue" or "need help"... You should keep an eye out for these issues as they are likely the best candidates for you if you are just starting. Keep your eyes open for any comments on issues. If you are confident in taking one, you should communicate that through a comment on the issue.

However, if you are completely new to this project it is advised that you, first of all, deploy it and see what it does. There likely exists documentation about how to do that. It is also advised to skim through the documentation of a project to familiarize yourself with the nomenclature.

You can also look through the pull requests of a project ([example](https://github.com/bUnit-dev/bUnit/pulls)). This will give you insight into the codebase and the coding standards.

## How to reach out?

It can be intimidating to come to a new project and just start writing code into it. Don't worry, we've all been there. When you get stuck, it is fine to reach out for help. BUT! Before you do that, try to resolve the issue to the best of your abilities:
- Read through the forum (if there is one).
- Read through the documentation.
- Check the open issues.
- Do your homework...

If after this, you still cannot answer the question you have, do go ahead and reach out. To reach out you can:
- Comment on the issue you've taken.
- Write to the forum.
- Open a new issue on the project.
- Ping a colleague who is on the project.
- !Try to keep all communication public!

But before you do, I recommend reading [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) on how to ask a coding question well.

## How to submit a contribution - pull request?
A pull request is an approach we use to contribute changes to the project. The change does not have to be final to open the pull request. It is usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Make sure to mark the pull request as WIP - work in progress.
Here are the steps to make a change and submit a pull request on GitHub:
- [Fork the repository and clone it locally.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).
- [Create a branch.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)
- Reference your issue in the title or description. (example. Closes #37)
- Document your change well and describe the solution.
- If your change affects the UI submit add a screenshot.
- Always write the appropriate tests for your changes.
- Align your code with the repositories standards.
- [Push your changes (same article as above)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects)

Now keep your eyes open for reviews and address any valid comments.
