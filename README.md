This document is your entry point to all things open-source at Tretton37.

## Getting started

- We have an [Open-Source Policy](policy.md). A document containing the do's and dont's of working on open-source projects while working at Tretton37. Please read it or at least skim through.
- If you are new to open-source you should also read this [Contribution Guide](contribution-guide.md) on what it means to contribute to open-source projects.
- Now something a bit more fun. Here is a [Github Profile Guide](/github-guide.md) on how to improve your github profile, your project readmes and your github pages.
